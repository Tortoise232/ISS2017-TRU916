		_**Tutorial for setting-up the project from GIT**_
- First clone the repository with "_git clone + the repository path_".

- Enter in the folder.

- To get the develop branch write git _"pull --rebase origin developementDatabase_" and after that "_git checkout develop_"

- Use Import Project form InteliJ and add the first 2 options for the project and check **Use Default Gradle Wrapper**,
choose the creation folder (the folder you cloned the repository).

- Navigate into the project directory  in **WebConference>src>main>webapp**  and  open a Terminal (Linux)/CMD (Windows), in that folder,  and run the command "_npm install_"

- For the Postgres you will need to add a new DB with name "**_WebConferenceDB_**" and have an user with **_Name_: postgres and _Password_: postgres**


                    **_In theory it should work!! :))_**
